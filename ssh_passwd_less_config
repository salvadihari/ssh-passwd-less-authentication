create ssh-keygen key's in your master server
then give the below command

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <user>@<slave machine ip> 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys && echo "Key copied"'

if you get below error:
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).

then go to the below file inyour slave/target server
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

and copy past the below lines in config file

PermitRootLogin yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication yes

Now restart the sshd service by below command

systemctl restart sshd

now give the below command

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <user>@<slave machine ip> 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys && echo "Key copied"'

now it should copy the ssh pub key to the slave server

do the ssh login to the slave server from master 
first time it will ask you to enter the password, from next time onwords you can access the server with out any passwd.
